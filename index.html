		Death Doulas and the Changing Face of Passing On in America

			The first encounter I had with death was at the age of 12. My maternal grandmother, Janet Ojigho, had passed away from complications with dementia at the age of 85 in Delta State, Nigeria. I had always understood the concept of death but, for the first time, I experienced the end of a life.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Knowing Janet was nearing her end, members of her community would pay her daily visits, check up on the family members, and prepare the way for her passing. Despite knowing my grandmother was nearing the end of her life, her family and community took care of and looked after her till the very end. Not once did the conversation of putting her in a home or hospital ward come up; it only felt natural that the world around her would see her to her final resting place just as they have from the beginning. When her family could not be there or help out, the community took the lead. She was never in need of love, comfort, family, or aid. This not only prolonged her life in more ways than I can count by keeping her spirits up, fortifying her mind, and strengthening her physical health in turn, but it also made the death and grief process afterward a lot more bearable. Her death became less a ‘mourning of a life’ and more of a ‘celebration of a life’.
		</p>

		<p>
			Years later, I would experience the passage of life in a different way. One Sunday afternoon in Houston, TX, I followed my aunt, a social worker with the Texas Department of  Health and Human Services, on a call to a nearby nursing home. One of her clients had died the previous night. Walking through the halls of the nursing home and exploring the different rooms while my aunt took her report, I was filled with a deep sense of sorrow. Though saddened by the death of this stranger, the loneliness of the many people spending the end of their lives in this beige-colored hospital-like building was so palpable that it was difficult to avoid tears. On the drive home, I asked my aunt what would happen to the person who had passed away. She said the family had been notified and would make their way from across the country in a few days to decide what to do.
		</p>

		<p>
			The end-of-life process is both talked about and handled differently around the world. For my family in Nigeria, the culture around death was a communal one. However, this is not always the case in the United States.
		</p>

		<p>
			Death and grief in the United States are thoroughly avoided occurrences. From the abandonment of the dying elderly in nursing homes to quick funeral planning and processes to the often very short bereavement leave workplaces provide, the whole process is treated with as much brevity and avoidance as can be afforded. While most deaths in the country occur in hospitals, at least a quarter of Americans die in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/deathdoulas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nursing homes or hospice facilities</a>. Even the way grief is explored in pop culture makes the process seem linear and with a finality, instead of something that is ever-evolving and communally shared. Although this is the mainstream experience of the end-of-life process in the country, some subcultures embrace this time as one. Some Black American communities, like many in Louisiana, view the end of a life as a chance to celebrate the dead. The community gathers for music, funeral processions, dancing, and more. This outlook on the communal celebration of the dead is also shared in many Native American tribal traditions, such as that of the Ojibwe. The family of the dying care for them until they pass. That’s when the family and community prepare the body for the funeral rites and more. This relationship with the dying is a lot more intimate.
		</p>

		<p>
			Over the last few years, the dying process in America has begun to see significant shifts. While many still depend on nursing and retirement homes to care for the aging elderly, more communal concepts have begun being embraced. In particular, the profession of an end-of-life caregiver or death doula is gaining some agency.
		</p>

		<p>
			According to the International End-of-Life Doula Association (INELDA), a non-profit organization working to meet the non-medical needs of the dying by raising awareness of the roles of end-of-life doulas and providing education to support compassionate deathcare, a death doula “guides a person who is transitioning to death and their loved ones through the dying process.” This often includes but is not limited to caring for the dying, assisting in funeral planning, and helping the families of the deceased through the grieving process. Most importantly, they help with the emotional and psychical needs of the dying while creating a safe and peaceful transition out of the world of the living. With some undergraduate programs (including the University of Vermont, Eastwick College, and Marian University) offering certifications in this kind of care and more organizations being set up to create communities for it, death doulas are seeing a rise in visibility and agency in American culture. Pop culture is splattered with references to this career. The premiere of the third season of FX’s music-based dramedy ‘Atlanta’ saw a character bond with a death doula at a funeral; on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/deathdoulas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a>, #deathdoula has opened avenues for people to learn about the field; and 2022 movie ‘Moon Manor’ has the main character explore death with his family and friends (including his death doula) in a comedic way. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Nick Marrone, a 33-year-old death doula working in Brooklyn, NY, started this career after experiencing the loss of his grandmother in a car accident in 2019 and then his mother in 2020.

		</p>

		<p>
			“I became a death doula in the midst of the pandemic,” Marrone explains. “On my birthday, I had wished multiple times for significance and the next day, this random girl who I had never met before in my life, showed me a random video.”

			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVjkeUUxke8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The video</a> in question is one of Alua Arthur, a death doula and recovering attorney, explaining her career and the beauty it encompasses.
		</p>

		<p>
			“Never have I ever in my life seen anything like that,” Marrone says. “With everything she was saying, I was like ‘oh, yeah. Okay. Oh, that's me.’ After the video, I literally looked at the girl and I said, ‘I had been called to do that work for a very long time.’”
		</p>

		<p>
			Marrone’s encounter with end-of-life care during the COVID-19 pandemic is not unique to him alone. During this time, millions of families lost loved ones with many being displaced in the chaos. Funeral homes were overrun with new cases. According to the National Funeral Directors Association’s 2022 <a href="https://californiahealthline.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/2022_Cremation-and-Burial-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2022 Cremation and Burial Report</a>, funeral homes saw a 74.4% increase in caseload from 2021 to 2022, the height of the pandemic. The face of death care in the United States was altered for good.
		</p>

		<p>
			A Time Magazine report <a href="https://time.com/6128469/death-doulas-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found</a> that end-of-life care organizations such as “Doulagivers” would go on to train almost three times as many caregivers between 2019 and 2020 with the pandemic as a major cause.
		</p>

		<p>
			Marrone also believes the rise of death doulas is due to a generational and knowledge shift.
		</p>

		<p>
			“I think there's a familiarity that is slowly being recognized,” Marrone says. “The conversation is kind of cracking open a little bit. People are starting to think ‘I wish there was somebody that I could have had like this for my father or my mother’.”
		</p>

		<p>
			As much prominence as death doulas are gaining, they still face pushback. Marrone kept his career choice a secret for a long time because of the stigma that comes with working with death. For most Americans, death is a taboo, a morbid conversation that needs to be changed. Family and community members do not have an intimate relationship with the death and grief process. In a survey by Ethos, a life insurance company, <a href="https://time.com/6128469/death-doulas-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">death ranked last</a> in a list of taboo topics (money, religion,politics, etc.) Americans are willing to talk about. Marrone says people would look at him in a weird way and call him names once they found out. Even now as he does not hide it anymore, he still gets stigmatized for his choice.
		</p>

		<p>
			“It’s so hard to get people to take the hint that they will die one day,” Marrone says with a laugh. “It’s shocking to think of how many people don't think that they'll die eventually. But to even get that hint across is a miracle.”

			One would love to think the face of deathcare in the United States is changing swiftly; however, because the idea of end-of-life caregivers is still a relatively foreign concept, many are reluctant to seek out this kind of aid.
		</p>

		<p>
			Some of the problems also lie with the lack of a proper governing body. Aside from organizations like INELDA that act as a community for death doulas, this is still a widely ungoverned field. This is not a new thing. In countries where death doulas play a prominent role in the end-of-life process, there are still no national bodies dedicated solely to organizing them. However, unlike in the United States, most of these countries have certified doulas working with other national bodies, to create a cooperative and coordinated country-wide union. In New Zealand, after a death doula completes their training process, they also get certified with the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, the national body representing all hospice services in the country. Because of a lack of governance or collaborations like this in the United States, things like assisted death (which is still largely illegal in the country) are frowned upon.

			Despite the backlash many death doulas encounter when diving into this career, a lot of individuals still do it because of one crucial problem -  the flaws in the American end-of-life care system.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kris Kington Barker is an educator and death doula with INELDA. She worked as a nurse in the healthcare system for decades prior to getting into end-of-life caregiving and noticed neglect of those at the end of their lives by doctors and others in the medical community.
		</p>

		<p>
			“I noticed end-of-life care not being attended to in medical communities and kind of being left out,” Barker said. “At some point, I noticed that when people were dying in the hospitals we moved them to the back wards. We largely left them alone”
		</p>

		<p>
			Barker also argues that deathcare in the country is infamously individualistic and often devoid of warmth, mostly due to the way the dying are treated without as much care as healthy living individuals in the healthcare system. Research published earlier this year in the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management found the United States to rank <a href="https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/lcpc/quality-of-death/country-reports/USA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">43rd</a> of 81 countries when it came to end-of-life care. Other high-income countries included in the top 10 of the rankings include the United Kingdom, Australia, and Korea.
		</p>

		<p>
			Barker says her decades-long experience in the medical community absolutely colored her view of the end of a life forcing her to leave her life as a nurse and advocate for the dying.
		</p>

		<p>
			“In our modern community medicine here, especially in North America, what we have done is we've dissected dying out of health care,” Barker says. “We see health care as being only for the living. We see health care as something to preserve life, not something that's inclusive of dying.”
		</p>

		<p>
			This is not a sustainable model. When the dying are cut out of health care, it demarcates them from the rest of society as worthy of care or consideration. This sends the message that aging and the end of life are problems that should be ignored instead of embraced. The natural cycle of living beings which concludes with death then has the final process marked as unimportant. Hence, just like that day in Houston, we begin to see much of the dying aging population in socially <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/08982643211004174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">isolated spaces</a> like nursing homes.
		</p>

		<p>
			As Barker explains, the end of a person’s life is just as important as when they come into it and while they live it. Ignoring the final process only leads to incomplete healthcare.
		</p>

		<p>
			“It's unreasonable to think that everybody's going to stay alive forever,” Barker says. “There's a 100% mortality rate. The universe, everything dies. We expend a lot of energy and a lot of attention and time and money and resources to fixing people and keeping people alive. But when those things fail, we don't give them the same kind of emotional support, attention, and attempts for comfort for the remainder of their journey. It's just not complete care.”
		</p>

		<p>
			As more Americans try to fix death care in the country, it becomes more and more evident that dying with community is important. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I think often of Janet and what her final months would have been like without the love of the community around her. Let alone my mother, who had to grieve a parent. The people who surrounded her with love, care, and a listening ear before Janet’s death made it easier to say goodbye to the woman who brought her into the world. Even if this community is one person, it can make a world of difference. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Death doulas are making that difference.
